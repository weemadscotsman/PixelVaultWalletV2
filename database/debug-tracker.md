# PVX Blockchain Project Debug Tracker

## Current Issue
- PostgreSQL database error: `relation "staking_pools" does not exist`
- Error in badge controller: `Error checking mining badges: Error: Badge not found`
- Client-side still getting 502 response from API endpoints

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Fixed TransactionType references in controller files
2. ✅ Corrected PostgreSQL client import issues in server/database/index.ts
3. ✅ Added missing checkDatabaseConnection and closeDatabase functions
4. ✅ Created dbInit export object in server/database/dbInit.ts
5. ✅ Fixed schema.ts bigint column issue (added `mode: 'number'` to all bigint columns)
6. ✅ Fixed infinite recursion loop in blockchain initialization (removed connectToBlockchain calling initializeBlockchain)
7. ✅ Server now starts successfully and exposes port 5000

## Fix In Progress
- Database tables not being created properly

## Next Steps
1. Execute database migration to create missing tables
2. Fix badge not found error
3. Ensure API endpoints work correctly

## Roadmap Issues to Investigate
- Check database schema initialization code
- Fix WebSocket connection issues
- Verify route handlers correctly use the types from schema
- Resolve type inconsistency warnings
- Address LSP errors related to missing properties on types
