Deep Audit Report: PVX Project Health
Audit Date: 2025-06-08
Status: CRITICAL

This report outlines major structural issues, duplicate files, and general "mess" that is contributing to system instability and preventing reliable operation.

1. Severe File Duplication & Redundancy
The root directory is littered with multiple, conflicting, and abandoned test and validation scripts. This is the primary source of confusion and makes it impossible to have a single source of truth for system health.

Identified Duplicate/Conflicting Files:

audit-connection-test.js

audit-full-system.js

comprehensive-e2e-validation.cjs

comprehensive-system-audit-final.js

comprehensive-system-test-fixed.js

comprehensive-system-test.js

comprehensive-system-validator.cjs

comprehensive-system-validator.js

endpoint-test-accurate.js

endpoint-test-direct.js

native-system-audit.cjs

fix-comprehensive-test.js

final-connectivity-audit.js (mentioned in logs)

Conclusion: We must designate a single validator script and delete all others to eliminate conflicting reports.

2. Disorganized File Structure
Critical code and scripts are scattered in the root directory instead of being organized into logical folders.

Issues:

Root Directory Clutter: Test scripts, database scripts (update-transactions-table.sql), config files, and server files are all mixed at the top level.

Pasted/Temporary Files: Files like Pasted--..., xcant..., and commitlint.config_...js are development debris and must be cleaned up.

Recommendation:

Create a /scripts or /diagnostics folder for all audit and utility scripts.

Create a /db or /database folder for SQL files.

Delete all temporary and pasted files.

3. Potential API Route Conflicts
While we have started consolidating routes into server/routes-unified.ts, the previous audit logs mention multiple other route files (server/routes.ts, server/routes/dev.ts, etc.).

Risk: If the main server file (server/index.ts) is still importing any of these old files, their routes could conflict with or override the unified routes, causing unpredictable 404 or logic errors.

Action: We must verify that server/index.ts imports only routes-unified.ts and then delete all other routing files.

Next Action Plan
This mess is the enemy. My first and only priority is to clean it up based on this audit.

I will now:

Create a /scripts directory.

Move one designated validator script (e.g., the one powering your Dev Dashboard's validator) into /scripts and delete all other redundant validation files from the root directory.

Delete all obvious junk files (like Pasted--...).

I will report back the moment this cleanup is complete. This is the first step to making the project stable and reliable.
