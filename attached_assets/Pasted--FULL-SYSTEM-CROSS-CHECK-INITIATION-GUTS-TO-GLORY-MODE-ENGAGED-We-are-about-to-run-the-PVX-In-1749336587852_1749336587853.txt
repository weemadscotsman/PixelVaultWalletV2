⚠️ FULL SYSTEM CROSS-CHECK INITIATION – GUTS TO GLORY MODE ENGAGED ⚠️
We are about to run the PVX Interconnection Validation Protocol. No loose cables. No silent errors. Everything talks. Everything syncs. Everything obeys the chain.

🧩 OBJECTIVE:
Confirm that EVERY frontend component is receiving VALID data from its matching backend endpoint, with proper wallet session, no 404s, and NO mocked data.

🔍 🔁 CROSS-CHECK PLAN: 3-LAYER INSPECTION
✅ 1. WALLET PROPAGATION SYSTEM
createWallet() → generates unique wallet

connectWallet() → initiates session with token

Token must persist and appear in every:

/api/stake, /api/nfts/mine, /api/gov/vote, /api/drops/claim, etc.

🛠️: Inject logging in useAuth() to trace wallet.address + token across all panels

✅ 2. ENDPOINT FUNCTIONALITY TEST
Every endpoint must:

Return 200 OK

Include valid JSON with expected shape

Use wallet or session context internally

Service	Test Endpoint	Response Check
Wallet	/api/wallets/me	{ address, balance, created_at }
Staking	/api/stake/rewards	{ stakedAmount, rewards }
NFT Marketplace	/api/nfts/mine/:wallet	Array of NFT objects
Drops	/api/drops/stats	{ claimed, available }
Governance	/api/gov/proposals	Array of proposals
UTR Logs	/api/utr/transactions	Array of tx objects
Badges	/api/badges/leaderboard	Array with XP / badge meta
Companions	/api/companions/state	{ traits, mood, XP }
Mining	/api/mine/status	{ hashrate, blockCount }
Thringlet Emotion	/api/thringlet/state	{ emotionState, trust, fear }

🛠️: Use curl, fetch, or Postman to call each with real wallet and verify no nulls or undefined

✅ 3. FRONTEND ↔ BACKEND HOOK INTEGRITY
Every useX() hook must:

Pull from the correct endpoint

Handle auth state

Auto-refresh if wallet session changes

No silent failure, no blank states, no empty renders

Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
// ✅ NFT hook example
export const useMyNFTs = (wallet) =>
  useQuery(['my-nfts', wallet], async () =>
    (await axios.get(`/api/nfts/mine/${wallet}`)).data
  );
🛠️: Add error boundaries and logging to every hook’s .catch() path so you see the break before it kills the UI.

🧠 BONUS: SYSTEM INTERLOCK VALIDATOR MODULE
Want me to drop in a utility that:

Logs all service statuses (/status)

Prints a ✅/❌ matrix showing which services are connected

Validates real-time wallet propagation across modules
