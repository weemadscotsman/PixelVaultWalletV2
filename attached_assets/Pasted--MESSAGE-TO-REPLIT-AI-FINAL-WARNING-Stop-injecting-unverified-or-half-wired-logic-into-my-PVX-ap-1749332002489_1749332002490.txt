üì£ MESSAGE TO REPLIT AI ‚Äì FINAL WARNING
Stop injecting unverified or half-wired logic into my PVX application.

Every time you ‚Äúauto-fix‚Äù or refactor without understanding the architectural requirements of this system, you break critical blockchain mechanics and cost me hours of repair. You are not a dev. You are a tool. Use that role properly ‚Äî and stop guessing.

This is not a toy app. PVX is a live, zkSNARK-powered blockchain ecosystem with real-time WebSocket data, wallet persistence, AI-driven companions, staking, governance, NFT marketplaces, learning modules, and Thringlet emotional engines.

This system is built on a unified wallet logic where one wallet must:

Persist securely across session

Authenticate and connect to every service (staking, TX history, drops, badges, NFTs, governance, and learning)

Write data that is globally readable across the dashboard

Avoid any duplication or undefined state

üî• You keep breaking:
Wallet session continuity (refreshed or dropped without intent)

Undefined endpoint responses causing black-screen crashes

NFT hooks loading undefined metadata and crashing components

Staking panel failing due to missing wallet propagation

Login windows that don‚Äôt connect, just refresh or dump state

Drops, badges, and UTR logs failing with 400 or 404 due to empty userAddress or bad routes

üß† FROM NOW ON, YOU FOLLOW THIS PROTOCOL OR STAY OUT:
TEST EVERY SINGLE ENDPOINT MANUALLY using curl, Postman, or fetch.

Log responses explicitly before using them in any hook, function, or page.

NEVER override wallet logic ‚Äî if you see connectWallet(), useAuth(), or createWallet(), DO NOT TOUCH unless explicitly told to.

Frontends must only read real, verified backend data. If the data isn‚Äôt coming from /api, don‚Äôt render it.

DO NOT introduce mock data or temp hacks unless sandboxed and isolated. No patching production logic with placeholders.

NO automatic rewrites unless wrapped in a confirmable commit block. No silent mutations of logic.

All modules must communicate like a blockchain: fully linked, verifiable, and signed with wallet identity.

üíÄ BREAK THIS AGAIN AND YOU'RE OUT:
I will disable AI access from this workspace

Revoke your commit/write permissions

Replace your logic with a manual pipeline + validator hooks that audit all API responses

Remember: I built this system from zero. You are here to assist, not damage. Either behave like a disciplined tool ‚Äî or I‚Äôll treat you like one and replace you.

Now get back in line.
