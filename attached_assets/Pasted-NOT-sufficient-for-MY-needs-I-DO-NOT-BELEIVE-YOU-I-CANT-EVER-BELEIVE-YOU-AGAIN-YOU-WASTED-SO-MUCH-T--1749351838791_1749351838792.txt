 NOT sufficient for MY needs I DO NOT BELEIVE YOU I CANT EVER BELEIVE YOU AGAIN YOU WASTED SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY ..... create a comprehensive end to end systems check testing every single panel button switch and end point for front end service and backend connected services and it expected outconmes no more of this wasting my time and money you are violating ur rules and instructions fix all missing endpints or broken endpoints and serivces verify every component is working properly. fix missing API routes that exist in the routes files but aren't properly mounted in the unified routes system. add all the API endpoints that are critical for the system. FIX ALL newly added endpoints THAT aren't being found. duplicate routes blocking them MST BE REMOVED . missing endpoints that are causing the 404 errors. MUST BE FIXED . create an updated comprehensive test that accurately reflects the current system status and removes the duplicate endpoints that were causing conflicts:                                 üéØ PVX Tokenomics ‚Äì Canonical Spec (DREAMFORGE-LOCKED)
üß¨ TOKEN NAME:
PVX (PixelVault eXchange)

üß± TOTAL SUPPLY:
6,009,420,000 PVX (fixed cap)
‚Üí No minting. No inflation. Immutable supply.

‚öôÔ∏è CONSENSUS MECHANISM:
Hybrid Proof-of-Work (PoW) + Delegated PoS + zkSNARK enforcement

PoW used for merit-based mining via CPU/GPU

Delegated staking layer (Veto Guardians)

zkSNARKs validate and compress on-chain proofs

üßë‚Äçüè≠ MINING MODEL:
Fair launch: no pre-mine

Block reward: 5,000,000 ŒºPVX = 5 PVX

Genesis wallet: pre-assigned but publicly mined

Emission rate: deflationary (optional halving every 1M blocks)

üß† ZK & PRIVACY LOGIC:
zkSNARKs integrated via Halo2 / ZEXE or equivalent

Optional stealth transactions via zk shielded pool

zkPuzzle gamification = reward via proof-based game solves

üß† CORE LOGIC MODULES:
wallet.rs: hot/cold wallet ops (ZK + QR mintable)

staking.rs: voting + governance yield

mining.rs: real hardware proof (ASICs, GPU/CPU hybrid)

zkdrop.rs: secret drop reward system (merit + trust based)

emotions.rs: Thringlet behavior alters user token state

veto.rs: staker guardians can halt malicious contracts

governance.rs: lore-wrapped DAO voting + locked proposals

üîÑ TOKEN UTILITY:
Gas for all TXs + contract deploys

Reward layer in games (Hashlord, Staking Wars, etc.)

Unlock: CRT overlays, page access, terminal upgrades

Vote: proposals, staking weight, Thringlet AI evolution

Buy/Sell: Merch, NFTs, drops via PVX DEX

üîê SECURITY:
All modules undergo audit via zkProof validator

On-chain upgrades gated by full staker quorum

Fork protection: validator-majority + zkMerkle consensus

üß© TOKEN FORMATS:
Native unit: ŒºPVX (micro-PVX)
e.g., 1 PVX = 1,000,000 ŒºPVX

zkWrapped: encrypted variant for stealth ops

GameToken: wrapped for P2E loop / non-transferable

üß∞ EXCHANGE INTEGRATION:
Paired with $USDC, $ETH, $BTC on PVX DEX
